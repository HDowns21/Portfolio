This is my final project from my Information Security class. I researched the Sony hack that happened in 2014, in which a hacking group known as GOP used malware known as Destover to completely wipe out Sony's internal systems.
This paper provides a technical overview of the hacker's methods and offers suggestions on future preventative measures.
